# Jeri's Notes
This website contains my personal notes regarding math, academics and my research. I'm a big supporter of the [Open Science Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and to me this includes easily sharing and collaborating on my personal knowledge base. My intention is that all credible information that I have gathered regarding my work will be pushed here. 

More information about me can be found on [my personal website](https://jerivl.github.io)

# Folder Structure
This site can navigated through the directory menu on the left, the global graph view, or the search function. I denote the purpose of each file though its parent directory. Due to the intended nature of this site as a working document, consider all works to be ephemeral and updated to best suit my own purposes, with the exception of the files contained in `/blog`.
## `/blog`
Contains permanent articles regarding my opinions and experiences in mathematics, engineering, academia, etc. The only changes that I intend to make to these articles are technical corrections or ethical amendments should they arise. In most cases these will be appended to the end of the article.
