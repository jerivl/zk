# Jeri's Notes ([notes.jerivl.com](http://notes.jerivl.com))

This website contains my personal notes regarding math, academics and my research. I'm a big supporter of the [Open Science Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and to me this includes easily sharing and collaborating on my personal knowledge base. My intention is that all credible information that I have gathered regarding my work will be pushed here. Due to the intended nature of this site as a working document, **consider all works to be ephemeral and updated to best suit my own purposes, with the exception of the files contained in `/blog`.**

More information about me can be found on [my personal website](https://jerivl.github.io)

# How to use this site

This site can navigated through the directory menu on the left, the global graph view, or the search function. The left and right menus can be hidden/shown through a combination of the buttons in the top left and right corners of the page. The menu accessible from the settings button on the bottom left corner adjusts settings specific to your web session, including font size.

# Folder descriptions

I denote the purpose of each file though its parent directory.

##  Blog: `/blog`

Contains permanent articles regarding my opinions and experiences in mathematics, engineering, academia, etc. The only changes that I intend to make to these articles are technical corrections or ethical amendments should they arise. In most cases these will be appended to the end of the article.

## Literature Notes: `/literature`

Contains summaries and highlights from published works. Due to licensing reasons, I will not be able to host any linked PDFs publicly, but I will do my best of maintaining current bibliographic information.

## Atomic Notes: `/atomic`

Contains atomic notes, each containing a singular topic, to later be linked and referenced by related topics similar to other wiki style knowledge bases. These are heavily inspired by the [method of Evergreen notes / Zettlekasten note taking](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).
