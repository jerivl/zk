# 1 Measures

Basic concepts of measure theory and construction of measures on the real line

# 1.1 Introduction - the impossibility of ideal properties of a measure over $\mathbb{R}$

We want to measure sizes of subsets of a metric space. Ideally we would have the following properties:

i. If $E_1, E_2, \ldots$ is a finite or infinite sequence of disjoint sets, then

$$ \mu\left(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup \cdots\right)=\mu\left(E_1\right)+\mu\left(E_2\right)+\cdots .  $$

ii. If $E$ is congruent to $F$ (that is, if $E$ can be transformed into $F$ by translations, rotations, and reflections), then $\mu(E)=\mu(F)$.

iii. $\mu(Q)=1$, where $Q$ is the unit cube

$$ Q=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: 0 \leq x_j<1 \text { for } j=1, \ldots, n\right\} .  $$

However, this is not a tractable problem for all subsets of the real line, so we must then weaken one or more of these hypotheses.

If we were to weaken (i. additivity of countable sequences) so that we only consider finite unions, then limits/continuity would break. In addition, for dimensions greater than or equal to 3, additivity of finite sequences would be incompatible with (ii.) and (iii.) In 1924, Banach and Tarski proved that there does not exist $\mu: \mathcal{P}\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right) \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ that assigns positive, finite values to bounded open sets and satisfies (i) for finite sequences as well as (ii).

> [!Preposition: Banach Tarski Paradox, 1924]
Let $U$ and $V$ be arbitrary bounded open sets in $\mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 3$. There exist $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and subsets $E_1, \ldots, E_k, F_1, \ldots, F_k$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that
> - the $E_j$ 's are disjoint and their union is $U$;
> - the $F_j$ 's are disjoint and their union is $V$;
> - $E_j$ is congruent to $F_j$ for $j=1, \ldots, k$.

Thus one can cut up a ball the size of a pea into a finite number of pieces and rearrange them to form a ball the size of the earth! Needless to say, the sets $E_j$ and $F_j$ are very bizarre. They cannot be visualized accurately, and their construction depends on the axiom of choice.

**The best relaxation is that we discard the requirement that $\mu$ be defined on all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and instead construct $\mu$ on a class of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$**

# 1.2 $\sigma$-algebras
> [!def algebra of sets on a set]
> Let $X$ be a nonempty set. An algebra of sets on $X$ is a nonempty collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $X$ that is closed under finite unions and complements; in other words, if $E_1, \ldots, E_n \in \mathcal{A}$, then $\bigcup_1^n E_j \in \mathcal{A}$; and if $E \in \mathcal{A}$, then $E^c \in \mathcal{A}$.

> [!def $\sigma$-algebra]
> A $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra that is closed under countable unions.

(Some authors use the terms field and $\sigma$-field instead of algebra and $\sigma$-algebra.)

>[!lemma: properties of algebras / $\sigma$-algebras]
If $\mathcal{A}$ is a algebra over $X$ then, $X, \emptyset \in \mathcal{A}.$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under finite intersection. Additionally, if $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra over $x$ then $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under countable intersection.

Some examples of $\sigma$-algebras: If $X$ is any set, $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and $\{\varnothing, X\}$ are $\sigma$-algebras. For uncountable $X$,  the $\sigma$-algebra of countable or co-countable sets

> [!def $\sigma$ algebra of countable or co-countable sets]
> If $X$ is uncountable, then $$ \mathcal{A}=\left\{E \subset X: E \text { is countable or } E^c \text { is countable }\right\} $$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, called the $\sigma$-algebra of countable or co-countable sets. (The point here is that if $\left\{E_j\right\}_1^{\infty} \subset \mathcal{A}$, then $\bigcup_1^{\infty} E_j$ is countable if all $E_j$ are countable and is co-countable otherwise.)

Verify that the intersection of any family of $\sigma$-algebras on $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

> [!def $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{E}$]
> If $\mathcal{E}$ is any subset of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ there exists a unique smallest $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{E})$ containing $\mathcal{E}$ that is the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebras containing $\mathcal{E}$. $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{E})$ is called the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{E}$. $\mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfies this in the event that no smaller $\sigma$-algebra can be found

> [!Lemma 1.1]
> If $\mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{F})$ then $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{E}) \subset \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{F})$.

Proof. $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{F})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{E}$; it therefore contains $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{E})$.

> [!def Borel $\sigma$-algebra]
> If $X$ is any metric space, or more generally any topological space (see Chapter 4), the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the family of open sets in $X$ (or, equivalently, by the family of closed sets in $X$ ) is called the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ and is denoted by $\mathcal{B}_X$. Its members are called Borel sets. $\mathcal{B}_X$ thus includes open sets, closed sets, countable intersections of open sets, countable unions of closed sets, and so forth.

> [!def $G_\delta$,  $F_\sigma$, $G_{\delta\sigma}$, $F_{\sigma\delta}$, $G_{\delta\sigma\delta}$, ... ]
> - A countable intersection of open sets is called a $G_\delta$ set;
> - a countable union of closed sets is called an $\boldsymbol{F}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ set;
> - a countable union of $G_\delta$ sets is called a $\boldsymbol{G}_{\boldsymbol{\delta}}$ set;
> - a countable intersection of $F_\sigma$ sets is called an $\boldsymbol{F}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma} \delta}$ set
>
> We can induct on this definition to yield further subclasses of F and G sets

$\delta$ and $\sigma$ stand for the German Durchschnitt and Summe, that is, intersection and union.)

The Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the Real line is an object of interest that allows us to construct many reasonable measures.

> [!Proposition 1.2 generators of the Borel $\sigma$ algebra of the real line]
> $B_{\mathbb{R}}$ is generated by each of the following:
> a. the open intervals: $\mathcal{E}_1=\{(a, b): a<b\}$,
> b. the closed intervals: $\mathcal{E}_2=\{[a, b]: a<b\}$,
> c. the half-open intervals: $\mathcal{E}_3=\{(a, b]: a<b\}$ or $\mathcal{E}_4=\{[a, b): a<b\}$,
> d. the open rays: $\mathcal{E}_5=\{(a, \infty): a \in \mathbb{R}\}$ or $\mathcal{E}_6=\{(-\infty, a): a \in \mathbb{R}\}$,
> e. the closed rays: $\mathcal{E}_7=\{[a, \infty): a \in \mathbb{R}\}$ or $\mathcal{E}_8=\{(-\infty, a]: a \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

> [!def product $\sigma$-algebra]
> Let $\left\{X_\alpha\right\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be an indexed collection of nonempty sets, $X=\prod_{\alpha \in A} X_\alpha$, and $\pi_\alpha: X \rightarrow X_\alpha$ the coordinate maps. If $\mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, the product $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by
> $$ \left\{\pi_\alpha^{-1}\left(E_\alpha\right): E_\alpha \in \mathcal{M}_\alpha, \alpha \in A\right\} . $$
> We denote this $\sigma$-algebra by $\bigotimes_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{M}_\alpha$. (If $A=\{1, \ldots, n\}$ we also write $\bigotimes_1^n \mathcal{M}_j$ or $\left.\mathcal{M}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathcal{M}_n.\right)$

> [!Proposition 1.3]
> If $A$ is countable, then $\bigotimes_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\left\{\prod_{\alpha \in A} E_\alpha: E_\alpha \in \mathcal{M}_\alpha\right\}$.

> [!Proposition 1.4]
> Suppose that $\mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is generated by $\mathcal{E}_\alpha, \alpha \in A$. Then $\bigotimes_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is generated by $\mathcal{F}_1=\left\{\pi_\alpha^{-1}\left(E_\alpha\right): E_\alpha \in \mathcal{E}_\alpha, \alpha \in A\right\}$. If $A$ is countable and $X_\alpha \in \mathcal{E}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha, \bigotimes_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is generated by $\mathcal{F}_2=\left\{\prod_{\alpha \in A} E_\alpha: E_\alpha \in \mathcal{E}_\alpha\right\}$.

> [!Proposition 1.5]
> Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be metric spaces and let $X=\prod_1^n X_j$, equipped with the product metric. Then $\bigotimes_1^n \mathcal{B}_{X_j} \subset \mathcal{B}_X$. If the $X_j$ 's are separable, then $\bigotimes_1^n \mathcal{B}_{X_j}=\mathcal{B}_X$

> [!Corollary 1.6 ]
> $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}^n}=\bigotimes_1^n \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

> [!def elementary family]
> We define an elementary family to be a collection $\mathcal{E}$ of subsets of $X$ such that
> - $\varnothing \in \mathcal{E}$,
> - if $E, F \in \mathcal{E}$ then $E \cap F \in \mathcal{E}$,
> - if $E \in \mathcal{E}$ then $E^c$ is a finite disjoint union of members of $\mathcal{E}$.

> [!Proposition 1.7]
> If $\mathcal{E}$ is an elementary family, the collection $\mathcal{A}$ of finite disjoint unions of members of $\mathcal{E}$ is an algebra.

> [!def measure on a measurable space]
> Let $X$ be a set equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$. A measure on $\mathcal{M}$ (or on $(X, \mathcal{M})$, or simply on $X$ if $\mathcal{M}$ is understood) is a function $\mu: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ such that
> i. $\mu(\varnothing)=0$,
> ii. if $\left\{E_j\right\}_1^{\infty}$ is a sequence of disjoint sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\mu\left(\bigcup_1^{\infty} E_j\right)=\sum_1^{\infty} \mu\left(E_j\right)$ (countable additivity)

Note that condition (ii) countable additivity implies finite additive. Thus all measures are finitely additive

> [!def finitely additive measure]
> Let $X$ be a set equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$. A measure on $\mathcal{M}$ (or on $(X, \mathcal{M})$, or simply on $X$ if $\mathcal{M}$ is understood) is a function $\mu: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ such that
> i. $\mu(\varnothing)=0$,
> ii. if $\left\{E_j\right\}_1^{n}$ is a sequence of disjoint sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\mu\left(\bigcup_1^{n} E_j\right)=\sum_1^{n} \mu\left(E_j\right)$ (finite additivity)

> [!def measurable space / measure space / measurable set]
> If $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, $(X, \mathcal{M})$ is called a **measurable space** and the sets in $\mathcal{M}$ are called **measurable sets**. If $\mu$ is a measure on $(X, \mathcal{M})$, then $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ is called a **measure space**.

> [!def finite / $\sigma$-finite / semifinite measure]
> Let $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ be a measure space. These terms concern the "size" of $\mu$.
> - If $\mu(X)<\infty$ (which implies that $\mu(E)<\infty$ for all $E \in \mathcal{M}$ since $\left.\mu(X)=\mu(E)+\mu\left(E^c\right)\right), \mu$ is called **finite**.
> - If $X=\bigcup_1^{\infty} E_j$ where $E_j \in \mathcal{M}$ and $\mu\left(E_j\right)<\infty$ for all $j, \mu$ is called $\sigma$-finite. More generally, if $E=\bigcup_1^{\infty} E_j$ where $E_j \in \mathcal{M}$ and $\mu\left(E_j\right)<\infty$ for all $j$, the set $E$ is said to be **$\sigma$-finite** for $\mu$. ( $E$ is of $\sigma$-finite measure.)
> - If for each $E \in \mathcal{M}$ with $\mu(E)=\infty$ there exists $F \in \mathcal{M}$ with $F \subset E$ and $0<\mu(F)<\infty, \mu$ is called **semifinite**.

$\mu$ is finite $\implies$ $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite $\implies$ $\mu$ is semifinite. The second implication Exercise 13

Most practical measures are $\sigma$-finite, and non-$\sigma$-finite measures exhibit pathological behavior

Several examples of measures
